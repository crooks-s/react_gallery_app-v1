TeamTreehouse Unit 7 Project

This is a Team Treehouse project in which a single page application was built using the following skills:
1) Vite
2) React 
3) React Router
4) PropTypes
5) Fetch API

This SPA uses the Flickr API to generate 24 photos of 3 pre-selected search tags: 'cats', 'dogs', and computers. It also has a search input field in which a user can search for a specific tag. This SPA is basic and could use a lot more work such as tracking the user's URL history for forward/back buttons, add a 'loading...' indicator to improve UX as page loads, and add a proper catch method to display a user-friendly error message if there is an issue fetching the requested data.
