# React Gallery Application
## Introduction
Treehouse Unit 7 Project. This SPA uses the Flickr API to generate photos of pre-selected serach tags. The user may also search for a specific tag using the search field. 
<br />**NOTE**: I am not hosting a live version due to an issue with the API key on deployment.

## Tech Stack
HTML/CSS. JavaScript. React.js. Vite.

## Process/Learning (to be updated)
1) Vite
2) React 
3) React Router
4) PropTypes
5) Fetch API

## Improvement (to be updated)
This SPA is basic and could use a lot more work such as tracking the user's URL history for forward/back buttons, add a 'loading...' indicator to improve UX as page loads, and add a proper catch method to display a user-friendly error message if there is an issue fetching the requested data. 

## Running the Project
Clone the project.
<br /> In terminal, ensure you are in root directory.
<br /> Run ```npm install``` or ```npm i``` to install dependencies.
<br /> Run ```npm start``` to start server.
<br /> In your selected web browser, go to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
